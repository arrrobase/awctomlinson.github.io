Common OCT angiography (OCTA) artifacts have previously
been extensively described. The consequences of defocus have
been shown, but the quantitative significance of even subtle
changes in defocus have not been previously reported. After
receiving institutional review board approval, sequential OCTA
scans (AngioVue, Optovue, Fremont, CA) of a single eye of a
normal participant were obtained; the scans demonstrated a
purposeful progressive increase in the manual defocus setting
from the optimum (Fig 1, A-D). Incorrect focus settings
limited the ability to visualize fine capillary vessels and caused
an apparent thickening of the remaining vasculature.
Consequently, vessel density outputs in the retina decreased
steadily (56.6%, 50.1%, 48.1%, 46.2%, Fig 1, EeH,
respectively). Despite this, the signal strength index remained
above the accepted quality threshold of 55 for all images.
Therefore, when assessing an OCTA image without obvious
motion artifacts, signal strength index is necessary, but not
sufficient, for high-quality OCTA scans and valid data. Attention to 
image focus is paramount, and the presence of defocus of
the retinal vasculature in OCTA datasets may elude casual
inspection and result in inaccurate quantification.
