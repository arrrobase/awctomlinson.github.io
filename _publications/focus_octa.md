Common OCT angiography (OCTA) artifacts have previously been extensively described.1,2 The consequences of defocus have been shown,3 but the quantitative significance of even subtle changes in defocus have not been previously reported. After receiving institutional review board approval, sequential OCTA scans (AngioVue, Optovue, Fremont, CA) of a single eye of a normal participant were obtained; the scans demonstrated a purposeful progressive increase in the manual defocus setting from the optimum (Fig 1, A–D).
